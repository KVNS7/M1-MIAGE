A formal approach to address this challenge involves modeling it as an optimization problem: given a professional staff, how can they be organized to optimize the number of communication channels, considering both intra-team and inter-team channels? In this article, we propose applying a set of bio-inspired algorithms to solve this problem. We introduce an enhancement that incorporates ensemble learning into the resolution process to achieve nearly optimal results. Ensemble learning integrates multiple machine-learning strategies with diverse characteristics to boost optimizer performance. Furthermore, the studied metaheuristics offer an excellent opportunity to explore their linear convergence, contingent on the exploration and exploitation phases. The results produce more precise definitions for team sizes, aligning with industry standards. Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional versions of these algorithms.",2024,2025-05-22 17:54:55,2025-05-26 13:12:07,2025-05-22 17:54:20,292,,5,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,Publisher: MDPI,,/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/DL48DDHL/Olivares et al. - 2024 - Intelligent learning-based methods for determining the ideal team size in agile practices.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

922UZ3CX,thesis,2021,"Seeley, Shane",The effect of unbalancing team size on the physical and technical demands of small-sided games using elite reserve team soccer players,,,,,https://theses.gla.ac.uk/id/eprint/82445,"At professional soccer clubs, players within the same club often require a different training stimulus on a given day based on different preceding training/match exposure and different responses to the same training stimulus. Despite large amounts of research into small-sided games (SSGs), there has be no previous research investigating whether unbalancing team size in SSGs results in differential physical and technical demands between teams. The aim of this study, therefore, is to investigate the physical and technical demands of different team sizes within unbalanced SSGs. 20 elite male soccer players (age: 19 ± 1 yr; height: 179.1 ± 5.6 cm; body mass: 71.4 ± 12.4 kg) from the reserve team of a Scottish Premier League club took part in the study during the in-season phase of the 2019/2020 season. Physical demands were measured using GPSports EVO 10-Hz GPS units along with polar H1 heart rate sensors (5 kHz). SSGs were recorded using a GoPro HERO7 4K video camera and technical demands (and possession) were recorded retrospectively by analysing the footage using Nacsport Scout PLUS video analysis software. The game formats used were 5 vs 5 (control group), 6 vs 4 and 7 vs 3, plus the goal keepers. There was 6 testing days throughout the season with 2 testing days per format (12 games total). Game format order was randomised every 3 testing days. SSGs were performed in a 2 x 4 minute fashion with 90 seconds rest between with only one format (e.g. 6 vs 4) measured per testing day. In addition to the above study protocol, 2 seasons of second day recovery data from the first team was compiled to put any “lower-intensity” data into context of the clubs periodisation strategy. The results show no significant differences between any individual physical or technical variables of the smaller, disadvantaged teams and the control. In contrast, the larger teams had significantly lower physical demands. Compared with the control group, the team of 7 had significantly lower mean total distance (284 vs 407 m), heart rate (73 vs 85 %HRmax), maximum velocity (18 vs 21 km.h-1), high-intensity running distance (0.1 vs 6.3 m) and decelerations (0.7 vs 1.6) per game. The results of the team of 7 showed great compatibility with the second day recovery data. The team of 3 and 4 had significantly lower possession compared with their opposition team of 7 and 6 respectively (35-37 vs 63-65 %). As a team, the team of 7 took significantly more shots than the control group (12 vs 7). The significantly lower demands of the advantaged teams and the control combined with the lack of differences between the disadvantaged teams and the control suggest that different periodisation targets can be hit within the same SSG. This means that recovery groups can be combined with regular training groups. This can lead to increased team cohesion, training enjoyment, and technical/technical development. It could also help younger athletes receive an optimal physical stimulus (in relation to the next match) when training with older teams for one-off sessions, thus allowing them to perform more matches throughout the season. Finally, the technical and tactical differences can be used to develop these skills e.g. how do 4 defenders deal with 6 attacking players and also reduce overtraining in select players.",2021,2025-05-22 17:54:55,2025-05-26 13:13:33,2025-05-22 17:54:35,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,,,PhD Thesis,,,Google Scholar,,,,/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/6FNWR9KP/Seeley - 2021 - The effect of unbalancing team size on the physical and technical demands of small-sided games using.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Drawn from a collaboration network of 114,577 scholars, we first investigate the relationships between team size and both research productivity and impact. In the first-degree network (i.e., a network that consists of the focal author, the coauthors, and the connections among the nodes), productivity is positively associated with team size, while team size and research impact exhibit an inverted-U shaped relationship. In the second-degree network (i.e., a network that consists of the focal author, the coauthors, the coauthors’ coauthors, and the connections among the nodes), both research productivity and impact suggest an inverted-U shaped relationship with the team size of second-degree connections. We also find that research variety exerts a moderating effect on the relationships between team size and research performance. With the increase in research variety, the curvilinear relationship between first-degree team size and research productivity steepens, whereas the inverted-U shaped relationship between first-degree team size and research impact first flattens and then displays a U-shaped relationship. In the second-degree network, team size exerts little influence on research productivity when research variety is extremely small, and such an effect becomes inverted-U shaped when research variety increases. The turning point for the inverted-U shaped relationship between second-degree team size and research impact continues to shift to the left and down as research variety increases.",2021,2025-05-22 17:54:55,2025-05-26 13:13:24,2025-05-22 17:54:37,101205,,4,15.0,,,"Team size, research variety, and research performance",,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,Publisher: Elsevier,,/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/85KIWBJ6/S1751157721000766.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

In understanding leadership impact in team networks, an important question concerns the structural influence of leader centrality in advice-giving networks on team performance. Taking the inconsistent evidence for the positive relationship of network centrality and leadership effectiveness as a starting point, we suggest that the positive impact of leader centrality in advice-giving networks is contingent on team needs for leadership to meet communication and coordination challenges, which we argue are larger in larger teams. Developing our analysis, we examine the mediating role of member collaboration in the relationship of leader network centrality and team performance as moderated by team size. Based on a multi-source dataset of 542 employees and 71 team leaders, we found that leader centrality in advice-giving networks related positively to team performance in larger teams but negatively in smaller teams.

Previous work has introduced a multiagent reinforcement learning-based model as a design approach to solving the rule generation problem with complex tasks. A deep multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm was devised to train self-organizing agents for knowledge acquisition of the task field and social rules. The results showed that there is an optimal number of agents that achieve good learning stability and system performance. However, finding such a number is nontrivial due to the dynamic task constraints and unavailability of agent knowledge before training. Although extensive training can eventually reveal the optimal number, it requires training simulations of all agent numbers under consideration, which can be computationally expensive and time consuming. Thus, there remains the issue of how to predict such an optimal team size for self-organizing systems with minimal training experiments. In this article, we proposed a measurement of the complexity of the self-organizing system called effective entropy, which considers the task constraints. A systematic approach, including several key concepts and steps, is proposed to calculate the effective entropy for given task environments, which is then illustrated and tested in a box-pushing case study. The results show that our proposed method and complexity measurement can accurately predict the optimal number of agents in self-organizing systems, and training simulations can be reduced by a factor of 10.",2024,2025-05-22 17:54:55,2025-05-26 13:11:39,2025-05-22 17:54:47,,,8,24.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,Publisher: American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Theory and prior evidence are contradictory or inconclusive at least. Indeed, a resource dependency theory perspective suggests that larger teams have access to more resources, which should positively affect fundraising success. In contrast, a team effectiveness perspective suggests that larger teams incur higher coordination costs, which should negatively affect fundraising success. In this article, we address this theoretical paradox by arguing for a curvilinear effect between team size and fundraising success. By drawing on the liabilities of newness and smallness perspectives, we further argue that firm age and size will serve as important moderators. For this study, we exploit data from equity crowdfunding (ECF) markets. In Study 1, we examine the population of 2942 initial ECF offerings from three ECF platforms in the U.K. We provide first-time evidence of the inverted U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurial team size and the fundraising success of the ECF offering. Specifically, an entrepreneurial team of four members exhibits the highest probability in terms of ECF offering success. Moreover, we show that the inverted U-shape is stronger for younger and smaller firms relative to older and larger firms, respectively. In Study 2, we examine 256 initial ECF offerings from an Italian ECF platform and find broadly consistent results on the inverted U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurial team size and fundraising success.",2024,2025-05-22 17:54:55,2025-05-26 13:11:11,2025-05-22 17:54:53,,,,,,,Entrepreneurial team size and fundraising success,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,Publisher: IEEE,,/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/A25PYZ5U/Monaco et al. - 2024 - Entrepreneurial team size and fundraising success Evidence from equity crowdfunding.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

The results of ordinary least square estimation and instrumental variable estimation indicate that the size of inventor teams under rice culture is significantly smaller than that under wheat culture by 0.558–0.721 persons. Using the Chinese Qinling–Huaihe line, this paper constructs a regression discontinuity (RD) design. The local average treatment effect estimation confirms the difference in rice and wheat cultures. Subsequently, we demonstrate the significant existence of this difference through lots of robustness checks.

Design/methodology/approach Based on ESI database from year 2009–2019, the paper describes changes of collaboration team size from one author to more than 10 authors in 22 disciplines. Kernel density estimation and multidimensional kernel density estimation method are used to calculate optimal collaboration team size and appropriate collaboration team size in 22 disciplines. As bandwidth is one of the major issues in construction of kernel density estimation, the paper uses five different algorithms to calculate bandwidth. The method with the lowest mean absolute percentage error is chosen. Robustness test is conducted based on different sets of data. Findings The results show that scientific collaboration becomes more widely and deeply. As time goes by, collaboration team size is becoming larger and larger. Natural science disciplines have larger collaboration team size and faster growth rate than social science disciplines.

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the influence of an agent on team processes in a team consensus gambling task. Teams were either two or three humans and a machine agent. Participants completed fifty rounds of a gambling task, similar to the game roulette. In each round, team members entered their belief about what the next round outcome would be, a proposed wager, and how confident they were. The machine agent also made a suggestion regarding outcome and wager, but its accuracy was fairly low. The human team members then had to come to a consensus regarding outcome and wager. Overall, the agent exerted significant influence on team decision making, wagering, and confidence. Contrary to initial predictions, team size had only a modest effect, mostly on confidence ratings.
