In most of the cases, inaccurate estimates tend to wastage of these resources. Very few generalised models have been found in the literature. These models have been developed using the prototype dataset of the organisation. The project management team of an organisation tries to predict the effort needed for the development of software using various mathematical techniques. These techniques are mostly based on statistical methods (viz. simple linear regression (SLR), multi linear regression, support vector machine, cascade correlation neural network (CCNN) etc.) and some probability‐based models. They use historical data of similar projects. The work presented in this article envisages the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and constructive cost model (COCOMO), where SVR can be used for both linear and non‐linear models and COCOMO can be used as a regression model. The proposed hybrid model has been tested on the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group dataset. The data has been grouped according to the size of man power. It has been found that the proposed model yields better results than the SVR or SLR for each group of data in general.","2021-12","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-26 13:09:48","2025-05-22 17:54:19","365-375","","6","15","","IET Software","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/V83A4AVN/Rai et al. - 2021 - A hybrid model for prediction of software effort based on team size.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A formal approach to address this challenge involves modeling it as an optimization problem: given a professional staff, how can they be organized to optimize the number of communication channels, considering both intra-team and inter-team channels? In this article, we propose applying a set of bio-inspired algorithms to solve this problem. We introduce an enhancement that incorporates ensemble learning into the resolution process to achieve nearly optimal results. Ensemble learning integrates multiple machine-learning strategies with diverse characteristics to boost optimizer performance. Furthermore, the studied metaheuristics offer an excellent opportunity to explore their linear convergence, contingent on the exploration and exploitation phases. The results produce more precise definitions for team sizes, aligning with industry standards. Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional versions of these algorithms.","2024","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-26 13:12:07","2025-05-22 17:54:20","292","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: MDPI","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/DL48DDHL/Olivares et al. - 2024 - Intelligent learning-based methods for determining the ideal team size in agile practices.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While larger teams were traditionally believed to be more productive and produce higher-quality software, recent research has shown that this relationship is more complex than originally thought. The paper examines several studies that have found conflicting results, highlighting the need for further research to explore the moderating factors that influence this relationship. The research suggests that team communication and coordination, developer experience, and project complexity are key factors that may interact with team size to influence software quality. Future studies should consider these moderating factors and use a range of quality metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of software quality. These findings have important implications for project managers and software development teams who need to make informed decisions about team size and project planning. By optimizing team size and considering the factors that influence software quality, they can improve the overall quality of their software products. Effective communication and coordination among team members are critical to ensure that development efforts are aligned and productive, particularly when dealing with larger teams. Additionally, developers’ experience and the complexity of the project can affect the software quality outcome. Therefore, project managers must evaluate these factors and tailor team size and project planning accordingly to meet the desired quality objectives. Overall, the research provides insights into the complex relationship between team size and software quality, which can help project managers and software development teams make informed decisions to optimize their development efforts. By leveraging the moderating factors that influence software quality, teams can better understand how to improve their software products’ overall quality, leading to better outcomes for their organizations and end-users.","2023","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-26 13:11:22","2025-05-22 17:54:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Authorea","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/LKULA3W6/Bodaragama et al. - 2023 - Exploring the Impact of Team Size on Software Quality.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"922UZ3CX","thesis","2021","Seeley, Shane","The effect of unbalancing team size on the physical and technical demands of small-sided games using elite reserve team soccer players","","","","","https://theses.gla.ac.uk/id/eprint/82445","At professional soccer clubs, players within the same club often require a different training stimulus on a given day based on different preceding training/match exposure and different responses to the same training stimulus. Despite large amounts of research into small-sided games (SSGs), there has be no previous research investigating whether unbalancing team size in SSGs results in differential physical and technical demands between teams. The aim of this study, therefore, is to investigate the physical and technical demands of different team sizes within unbalanced SSGs. 20 elite male soccer players (age: 19 ± 1 yr; height: 179.1 ± 5.6 cm; body mass: 71.4 ± 12.4 kg) from the reserve team of a Scottish Premier League club took part in the study during the in-season phase of the 2019/2020 season. Physical demands were measured using GPSports EVO 10-Hz GPS units along with polar H1 heart rate sensors (5 kHz). SSGs were recorded using a GoPro HERO7 4K video camera and technical demands (and possession) were recorded retrospectively by analysing the footage using Nacsport Scout PLUS video analysis software. The game formats used were 5 vs 5 (control group), 6 vs 4 and 7 vs 3, plus the goal keepers. There was 6 testing days throughout the season with 2 testing days per format (12 games total). Game format order was randomised every 3 testing days. SSGs were performed in a 2 x 4 minute fashion with 90 seconds rest between with only one format (e.g. 6 vs 4) measured per testing day. In addition to the above study protocol, 2 seasons of second day recovery data from the first team was compiled to put any “lower-intensity” data into context of the clubs periodisation strategy. The results show no significant differences between any individual physical or technical variables of the smaller, disadvantaged teams and the control. In contrast, the larger teams had significantly lower physical demands. Compared with the control group, the team of 7 had significantly lower mean total distance (284 vs 407 m), heart rate (73 vs 85 %HRmax), maximum velocity (18 vs 21 km.h-1), high-intensity running distance (0.1 vs 6.3 m) and decelerations (0.7 vs 1.6) per game. The results of the team of 7 showed great compatibility with the second day recovery data. The team of 3 and 4 had significantly lower possession compared with their opposition team of 7 and 6 respectively (35-37 vs 63-65 %). As a team, the team of 7 took significantly more shots than the control group (12 vs 7). The significantly lower demands of the advantaged teams and the control combined with the lack of differences between the disadvantaged teams and the control suggest that different periodisation targets can be hit within the same SSG. This means that recovery groups can be combined with regular training groups. This can lead to increased team cohesion, training enjoyment, and technical/technical development. It could also help younger athletes receive an optimal physical stimulus (in relation to the next match) when training with older teams for one-off sessions, thus allowing them to perform more matches throughout the season. Finally, the technical and tactical differences can be used to develop these skills e.g. how do 4 defenders deal with 6 attacking players and also reduce overtraining in select players.","2021","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-26 13:13:33","2025-05-22 17:54:35","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Glasgow","","","","PhD Thesis","","","Google Scholar","","","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/6FNWR9KP/Seeley - 2021 - The effect of unbalancing team size on the physical and technical demands of small-sided games using.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawn from a collaboration network of 114,577 scholars, we first investigate the relationships between team size and both research productivity and impact. In the first-degree network (i.e., a network that consists of the focal author, the coauthors, and the connections among the nodes), productivity is positively associated with team size, while team size and research impact exhibit an inverted-U shaped relationship. In the second-degree network (i.e., a network that consists of the focal author, the coauthors, the coauthors’ coauthors, and the connections among the nodes), both research productivity and impact suggest an inverted-U shaped relationship with the team size of second-degree connections. We also find that research variety exerts a moderating effect on the relationships between team size and research performance. With the increase in research variety, the curvilinear relationship between first-degree team size and research productivity steepens, whereas the inverted-U shaped relationship between first-degree team size and research impact first flattens and then displays a U-shaped relationship. In the second-degree network, team size exerts little influence on research productivity when research variety is extremely small, and such an effect becomes inverted-U shaped when research variety increases. The turning point for the inverted-U shaped relationship between second-degree team size and research impact continues to shift to the left and down as research variety increases.","2021","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-26 13:13:24","2025-05-22 17:54:37","101205","","4","15","","","Team size, research variety, and research performance","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/85KIWBJ6/S1751157721000766.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were analysed using multivariate ANOVA. During maturity-matched games, technical actions decreased as team size increased. More mature players displayed greater technical actions in 4v4 compared to 6v6. Maturity-mismatched games revealed significant technical action differences for less mature players, particularly in 4v4 formats. More mature players covered greater high-intensity distances in maturity-matched and mismatched 6v6 games. Psychological scores were higher for more mature players in smaller team sizes (4v4), whereas less mature players showed consistent psychological scores across all formats.

While translational research leads to a number of positive outcomes, there are also a multitude of barriers to conducting effective team science, such as effective coordination and communication across the organizational, disciplinary, and even geographic boundaries of science teams. Given these barriers to success, there is a significant need to establish team interventions that increase science team effectiveness as translational research becomes the new face of science. This review is intended to provide translational scientists with an understanding of barriers to effective team science and equip them with the necessary tools to overcome such barriers.

Six model-based principles were developed based on extensive data analysis and in close interaction with practice. In particular, the principles involve insights in capacity planning, travel time, available effective capacity, contract types, and team manageability. The principles are formalized in terms of elementary mathematical models that capture the essence of decision-making. Numerical results based on real-life scenarios reveal that efficiency improves with team size, albeit more prominently for smaller teams due to diminishing returns. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the complexity of managing and coordinating a team becomes increasingly more difficult as team size grows. An estimate for travel time is provided given the size and territory of a team, as well as an upper bound for the fraction of full-time contracts, if split shifts are to be avoided.

In understanding leadership impact in team networks, an important question concerns the structural influence of leader centrality in advice-giving networks on team performance. Taking the inconsistent evidence for the positive relationship of network centrality and leadership effectiveness as a starting point, we suggest that the positive impact of leader centrality in advice-giving networks is contingent on team needs for leadership to meet communication and coordination challenges, which we argue are larger in larger teams. Developing our analysis, we examine the mediating role of member collaboration in the relationship of leader network centrality and team performance as moderated by team size. Based on a multi-source dataset of 542 employees and 71 team leaders, we found that leader centrality in advice-giving networks related positively to team performance in larger teams but negatively in smaller teams. Results supported the mediated moderation model via member collaboration in smaller teams, but not in larger teams.","2022-04","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-22 17:54:45","283-296","","2","37","","J Bus Psychol","Leader Network Centrality and Team Performance","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/U7AI6ZLN/Yuan et Van Knippenberg - 2022 - Leader Network Centrality and Team Performance Team Size as Moderator and Collaboration as Mediator.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous work has introduced a multiagent reinforcement learning-based model as a design approach to solving the rule generation problem with complex tasks. A deep multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm was devised to train self-organizing agents for knowledge acquisition of the task field and social rules. The results showed that there is an optimal number of agents that achieve good learning stability and system performance. However, finding such a number is nontrivial due to the dynamic task constraints and unavailability of agent knowledge before training. Although extensive training can eventually reveal the optimal number, it requires training simulations of all agent numbers under consideration, which can be computationally expensive and time consuming. Thus, there remains the issue of how to predict such an optimal team size for self-organizing systems with minimal training experiments. In this article, we proposed a measurement of the complexity of the self-organizing system called effective entropy, which considers the task constraints. A systematic approach, including several key concepts and steps, is proposed to calculate the effective entropy for given task environments, which is then illustrated and tested in a box-pushing case study. The results show that our proposed method and complexity measurement can accurately predict the optimal number of agents in self-organizing systems, and training simulations can be reduced by a factor of 10.","2024","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-26 13:11:39","2025-05-22 17:54:47","","","8","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theory and prior evidence are contradictory or inconclusive at least. Indeed, a resource dependency theory perspective suggests that larger teams have access to more resources, which should positively affect fundraising success. In contrast, a team effectiveness perspective suggests that larger teams incur higher coordination costs, which should negatively affect fundraising success. In this article, we address this theoretical paradox by arguing for a curvilinear effect between team size and fundraising success. By drawing on the liabilities of newness and smallness perspectives, we further argue that firm age and size will serve as important moderators. For this study, we exploit data from equity crowdfunding (ECF) markets. In Study 1, we examine the population of 2942 initial ECF offerings from three ECF platforms in the U.K. We provide first-time evidence of the inverted U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurial team size and the fundraising success of the ECF offering. Specifically, an entrepreneurial team of four members exhibits the highest probability in terms of ECF offering success. Moreover, we show that the inverted U-shape is stronger for younger and smaller firms relative to older and larger firms, respectively. In Study 2, we examine 256 initial ECF offerings from an Italian ECF platform and find broadly consistent results on the inverted U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurial team size and fundraising success.","2024","2025-05-22 17:54:55","2025-05-26 13:11:11","2025-05-22 17:54:53","","","","","","","Entrepreneurial team size and fundraising success","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: IEEE","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/A25PYZ5U/Monaco et al. - 2024 - Entrepreneurial team size and fundraising success Evidence from equity crowdfunding.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using patent data from the US pharmaceutical industry, empirical results show that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between inventor team size and high-quality innovation, and a negative relationship between inventor team size and low-quality innovation.

As the volume of medical literature grows, the citation set sizes and corresponding screening efforts increase. While larger team size and alternate screening methods have the potential to reduce workload and decrease SR completion times, it is unknown whether investigators adapt team size or methods in response to citation set sizes. Using a cross-sectional design, we sought to understand how citation set size impacts (1) the total number of authors or individuals contributing to screening and (2) screening methods.                                         Methods               MEDLINE was searched in April 2019 for SRs on any health topic. A total of 1880 unique publications were identified and sorted into five citation set size categories (after deduplication): < 1,000, 1,001–2,500, 2,501–5,000, 5,001–10,000, and > 10,000. A random sample of 259 SRs were selected (~ 50 per category) for data extraction and analysis.                                         Results                                With the exception of the pairwise t test comparing the under 1000 and over 10,000 categories (median 5 vs. 6,                 p                  = 0.049) no statistically significant relationship was evident between author number and citation set size. While visual inspection was suggestive, statistical testing did not consistently identify a relationship between citation set size and number of screeners (title-abstract, full text) or data extractors. However, logistic regression identified investigators were significantly more likely to deviate from gold-standard screening methods (i.e. independent duplicate screening) with larger citation sets. For every doubling of citation size, the odds of using gold-standard screening decreased by 15 and 20% at title-abstract and full text review, respectively. Finally, few SRs reported using crowdsourcing (                 n                  = 2) or computer-assisted screening (                 n                  = 1).                                                        Conclusions               Large citation set sizes present a challenge to SR teams, especially when faced with time-sensitive health policy questions. Our study suggests that with increasing citation set size, authors are less likely to adhere to gold-standard screening methods. It is possible that adjunct screening methods, such as crowdsourcing (large team) and computer-assisted technologies, may provide a viable solution for authors to complete their SRs in a timely manner.","2021-12","2025-05-22 17:56:40","2025-05-22 17:56:40","2025-05-22 17:56:22","142","","1","21","","BMC Med Res Methodol","Evaluating the relationship between citation set size, team size and screening methods used in systematic reviews","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/SID4GW4A/O’Hearn et al. - 2021 - Evaluating the relationship between citation set size, team size and screening methods used in syste.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper tries to figure out the relationship between scientific collaboration team size and scientific output. Design/methodology/approach Based on ESI database from year 2009–2019, the paper describes changes of collaboration team size from one author to more than 10 authors in 22 disciplines. Kernel density estimation and multidimensional kernel density estimation method are used to calculate optimal collaboration team size and appropriate collaboration team size in 22 disciplines. As bandwidth is one of the major issues in construction of kernel density estimation, the paper uses five different algorithms to calculate bandwidth. The method with the lowest mean absolute percentage error is chosen. Robustness test is conducted based on different sets of data. Findings The results show that scientific collaboration becomes more widely and deeply. As time goes by, collaboration team size is becoming larger and larger. Natural science disciplines have larger collaboration team size and faster growth rate than social science disciplines. Considering both qualitative and quantitative measures, the paper proves the universality of optimal and appropriate scientific collaboration team size among 22 disciplines and calculates the specific number. Originality/value The paper tries to investigate the law of scientific collaboration team size variation and provide a full picture of evolution of collaboration team size among 22 disciplines in 10 years.

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the influence of an agent on team processes in a team consensus gambling task. Teams were either two or three humans and a machine agent. Participants completed fifty rounds of a gambling task, similar to the game roulette. In each round, team members entered their belief about what the next round outcome would be, a proposed wager, and how confident they were. The machine agent also made a suggestion regarding outcome and wager, but its accuracy was fairly low. The human team members then had to come to a consensus regarding outcome and wager. Overall, the agent exerted significant influence on team decision making, wagering, and confidence. Contrary to initial predictions, team size had only a modest effect, mostly on confidence ratings. Experience with the agent also did not have much effect on the agent’s influence, even as the team was able to observe that the agent’s accuracy was low.

Additionally, previous research indicated the need to explore the relationship between team size and social identity salience regarding their effects on efficacy during competition. Therefore, the purpose of this quantitative experimental study was to examine if or to what extent there is a main effect of social identity salience upon self-efficacy and collective efficacy, and if there is an interaction effect between team size and social identity salience upon self-efficacy and collective efficacy. The final study sample included 180 U.S.-based adults recruited through Cloud Research (formerly TurkPrime). The present study used an online game simulation and measured pre-competition perceptions of selfand collective efficacy between participants primed with social identity salience and unprimed participants, and between participants assigned to a small team (3-on-3) and a large team (8-on-8). There were no main effects of social identity salience on ratings of self-efficacy, F(1, 168) = .097, p = .756, partial η2 = .001, or collective efficacy, F(1, 173) = .716, p = .399, partial η2 = .004; and social identity salience did not significantly interact with team size to produce effects on ratings of self-efficacy, F(1, 168) = 1.884, p = .172, partial η2 = .011, or collective efficacy, F(1, 173) = 2.369, p = .126, partial η2 = .014. Several limitations may have contributed to the absence of statistically significant results. There is also the possibility that social identity may not directly affect perceptions of efficacy or significantly interact with team size regarding their effects on efficacy.","2022","2025-05-22 17:56:40","2025-05-26 13:14:27","2025-05-22 17:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","Grand Canyon University","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social loafing has been widely examined through experimental studies, primarily conducted on face-to-face teams. The recent COVID-19 pandemic changed the working patterns around the world, increasing the amount of remote work in our society. This shift in working patterns resurfaces social loafing as an important area of research. Understanding the relationships between social loafing and its factors is important for increasing individual team members' efforts. This bachelor’s thesis aims to fill knowledge gaps by investigating the relationships between social loafing and the key factors explaining it. This research draws upon social identity and media richness theory to explain the relationships between individuals and groups and the role of communication mediums. Based on previous literature, we developed hypotheses concerning the effects of team size, cohesion, anonymity, and virtuality on social loafing. The findings reveal a significant correlation between team size, cohesion, and social loafing. Anonymity and virtuality showed no statistical significance with social loafing. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of key factors influencing social loafing. Future research is needed to explore the impact of these factors as well as additional factors that may contribute to the phenomenon that this study did not acknowledge.","2023","2025-05-22 17:56:40","2025-05-26 13:11:56","2025-05-22 17:56:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/TZGFRJAA/Zhong et Huuskonen - 2023 - Impact of team size, cohesion, anonymity, and virtuality on social loafing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
