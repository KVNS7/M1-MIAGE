T.; Vipulasiri, DMHD; DI, De Silva; JayakodY, TWSL",Exploring the Impact of Team Size on Software Quality,Authorea Preprints,,,,https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.168431236.62929306,"The relationship between team size and software quality has been a long-standing topic of debate in the software development industry. While larger teams were traditionally believed to be more productive and produce higher-quality software, recent research has shown that this relationship is more complex than originally thought. The paper examines several studies that have found conflicting results, highlighting the need for further research to explore the moderating factors that influence this relationship. The research suggests that team communication and coordination, developer experience, and project complexity are key factors that may interact with team size to influence software quality. Future studies should consider these moderating factors and use a range of quality metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of software quality. These findings have important implications for project managers and software development teams who need to make informed decisions about team size and project planning. By optimizing team size and considering the factors that influence software quality, they can improve the overall quality of their software products. Effective communication and coordination among team members are critical to ensure that development efforts are aligned and productive, particularly when dealing with larger teams. Additionally, developers’ experience and the complexity of the project can affect the software quality outcome. Therefore, project managers must evaluate these factors and tailor team size and project planning accordingly to meet the desired quality objectives. Overall, the research provides insights into the complex relationship between team size and software quality, which can help project managers and software development teams make informed decisions to optimize their development efforts. By leveraging the moderating factors that influence software quality, teams can better understand how to improve their software products’ overall quality, leading to better outcomes for their organizations and end-users.",2023,2025-05-22 17:54:55,2025-05-26 13:11:22,2025-05-22 17:54:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,Publisher: Authorea,,/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/LKULA3W6/Bodaragama et al. - 2023 - Exploring the Impact of Team Size on Software Quality.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

We examined COVID-19’s impact on National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded extramural principal investigators (PIs) affiliated with public health and preventive medicine departments across the country and their projects; assessed PIs’ confidence in achieving project goals; and investigated the role of age, sex, experience, and team size on PIs’ confidence in achieving project goals during the pandemic.                                         Methods:               We sent an anonymous online survey in January 2021 to 1076 extramural PIs affiliated with public health and preventive medicine departments at US institutions; 133 (12.4%) responded. We examined the impact of COVID-19 on the PIs, their project team operations, and their confidence that project objectives would be met, using Likert scales based on age, sex, team size, and PI experience.                                         Results:               Of 126 PIs, 94 (74.6%) felt that their day-to-day professional life was impacted a lot or a great deal by COVID-19. More female PIs than male PIs reported that their level of stress changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 125 PIs, 67 (53.6%) made major adjustments to research operations, 46 (36.8%) made minor adjustments, 5 (4.0%) halted research, and 7 (5.6%) reported not being affected. Of 123 PIs, 89 (72.4%) reported not using NIH COVID-19 accommodations. PIs who led projects 4 or 5 times felt more confident about meeting their research objectives than PIs who led projects 2 or 3 times.                                         Conclusions:               Future studies should investigate how to develop more engaging support and communication strategies to assist NIH researchers in mitigating the effects of pandemics or large-scale emergencies.",2023-03,2025-05-22 17:56:40,2025-05-22 17:56:40,2025-05-22 17:56:32,315-322,,2,138.0,,Public Health Rep,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on National Institutes of Health–Funded Researchers and Their Projects,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/W6AKYLDZ/Burnett et al. - 2023 - Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on National Institutes of Health–Funded Researchers and Their Projec.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
