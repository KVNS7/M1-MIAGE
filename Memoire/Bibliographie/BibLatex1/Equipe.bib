	abstract = {One of the significant challenges in scaling agile software development is organizing software development teams to ensure effective communication among members while equipping them with the capabilities to deliver business value independently. A formal approach to address this challenge involves modeling it as an optimization problem: given a professional staff, how can they be organized to optimize the number of communication channels, considering both intra-team and inter-team channels? In this article, we propose applying a set of bio-inspired algorithms to solve this problem. We introduce an enhancement that incorporates ensemble learning into the resolution process to achieve nearly optimal results. Ensemble learning integrates multiple machine-learning strategies with diverse characteristics to boost optimizer performance. Furthermore, the studied metaheuristics offer an excellent opportunity to explore their linear convergence, contingent on the exploration and exploitation phases. The results produce more precise definitions for team sizes, aligning with industry standards. Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional versions of these algorithms.},

	title = {Exploring the Impact of Team Size on Software Quality},

	abstract = {The relationship between team size and software quality has been a long-standing topic of debate in the software development industry. While larger teams were traditionally believed to be more productive and produce higher-quality software, recent research has shown that this relationship is more complex than originally thought. The paper examines several studies that have found conflicting results, highlighting the need for further research to explore the moderating factors that influence this relationship. The research suggests that team communication and coordination, developer experience, and project complexity are key factors that may interact with team size to influence software quality. Future studies should consider these moderating factors and use a range of quality metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of software quality. These findings have important implications for project managers and software development teams who need to make informed decisions about team size and project planning. By optimizing team size and considering the factors that influence software quality, they can improve the overall quality of their software products. Effective communication and coordination among team members are critical to ensure that development efforts are aligned and productive, particularly when dealing with larger teams. Additionally, developers’ experience and the complexity of the project can affect the software quality outcome. Therefore, project managers must evaluate these factors and tailor team size and project planning accordingly to meet the desired quality objectives. Overall, the research provides insights into the complex relationship between team size and software quality, which can help project managers and software development teams make informed decisions to optimize their development efforts. By leveraging the moderating factors that influence software quality, teams can better understand how to improve their software products’ overall quality, leading to better outcomes for their organizations and end-users.},
