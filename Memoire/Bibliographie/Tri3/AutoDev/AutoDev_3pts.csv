Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for facilitating autonomous agent interactions, enabling software engineering workflows to be more intelligent and adaptive. This paper explores a multi-agent LLM approach, where autonomous agents perform various roles such as requirement analysis, code generation, testing, and debugging. By leveraging natural language processing capabilities, these agents can communicate, make decisions, and execute tasks with minimal human intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that multi-agent LLMs can streamline software development, reduce human errors, and accelerate project timelines. However, challenges related to model interpretability, coordination complexities, and error handling remain critical concerns. This study discusses the benefits, limitations, and future implications of integrating multi-agent LLMs in software engineering, emphasizing the need for further research to enhance agent reliability, contextual awareness, and ethical considerations. The findings suggest that a well-structured autonomous agent system can significantly improve software engineering efficiency while complementing human expertise in an agile development environment.",2025,2025-05-22 20:00:52,2025-05-26 13:21:05,2025-05-22 20:00:18,,,,,,,Autonomous Agents in Software Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
