Autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems represent a strategic response to these challenges.

This paper proposes a comprehensive multi-dimensional taxonomy, engineered to analyze how autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems balance the dynamic interplay between autonomy and alignment across various aspects inherent to architectural viewpoints such as goal-driven task management, agent composition, multi-agent collaboration, and context interaction. Our taxonomy aims to empower researchers, engineers, and AI practitioners to systematically analyze the architectural dynamics and balancing strategies employed by these increasingly prevalent AI systems.

However, when faced with more complex and interconnected tasks that demand a profound and iterative thought process, LLMs reveal their inherent limitations. Autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems represent a strategic response to these challenges. Such systems strive for autonomously tackling user-prompted goals by decomposing them into manageable tasks and orchestrating their execution and result synthesis through a collective of specialized intelligent agents. Equipped with LLM-powered reasoning capabilities, these agents harness the cognitive synergy of collaborating with their peers, enhanced by leveraging contextual resources such as tools and datasets. While these architectures hold promising potential in amplifying AI capabilities, striking the right balance between different levels of autonomy and alignment remains the crucial challenge for their effective operation. This paper proposes a comprehensive multi-dimensional taxonomy, engineered to analyze how autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems balance the dynamic interplay between autonomy and alignment across various aspects inherent to architectural viewpoints such as goal-driven task management, agent composition, multi-agent collaboration, and context interaction. It also includes a domain-ontology model specifying fundamental architectural concepts. Our taxonomy aims to empower researchers, engineers, and AI practitioners to systematically analyze, compare, and understand the architectural dynamics and balancing strategies employed by these increasingly prevalent AI systems, thus contributing to ongoing efforts to develop more reliable and efficient solutions.

The models consist of multiple interacting agents representing real-world entities including stakeholders or organizations. They provide better understanding of the behaviour and decision-making processes in complex adaptive systems such as agri-food supply networks. We provide a taxonomy of multi-agent models in the agri-food sector based on their attributes, including agent types, degree of interaction, feedback, and learning. The article provides insights in their use in the wine supply network. We conducted a literature review and found a lack of research in the realms of stakeholder collaboration, technology adoption, and supply network efficiency. The results suggest that MAMS is used primarily in land use exploration and decision making for potential policy changes.",2024,2025-05-22 17:50:28,2025-05-26 12:44:49,2025-05-22 17:50:07,103-130,,,,,,,,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-45742-5_5,,,,,,"Galati, Antonino; Vrontis, Demetris; Thrassou, Alkis; Fiore, Mariantonietta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Context awareness is a prerequisite for the development of truly intelligent services, i.e. it is necessary to detect and understand the state of the space as well as events/activities taking place. Additionally, for the complete adaptation of the space to the user, it is necessary to take the user’s preferences into account. Defining user preferences is a very complex area with numerous approaches, starting with the development of simple automated services in a smart home, where the user is offered control of a simple set of rules to define their wants and needs. The paper conducts an analysis of preference definitions in different environments and proposes a preference definition for the use case of smart lighting and smart heating and cooling system in a Multi-Agent System approach. This proposed definition forms the basis for effective negotiation between users with different preferences, where conflicts are inevitable.",2025,2025-05-22 17:50:28,2025-05-26 12:43:53,2025-05-22 17:50:10,43-52,,,406.0,,,,,,,,Springer Nature Singapore,Singapore,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,"Series Title: Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies DOI: 10.1007/978-981-97-6469-3_4",,,,,,"Jezic, Gordan; Chen-Burger, Y.-H.; Kušek, Mario; Šperka, Roman; Howlett, Robert J.; Jain, Lakhmi C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

However, a multitude of hazards exist that possess the capability to undermine the integrity of the agent and pose a threat to the overall security of the system. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate and address security vulnerabilities during the process of creating Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). This survey assesses different models that aim to guarantee the security of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). These models were developed based on principles related to the agents' functionality and communication. This study offers a comprehensive examination and categorization of the prevailing threats targeting Multi-Agent Systems (MASs). Following this, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and assessment of diverse security strategies described in scholarly sources, classifying them into prevention, detection, and resiliency approaches based on their established credibility and reliability. In conclusion, we offer a suggestion for the optimal security approach to address particular types of threats, considering the most recent breakthroughs in the field of study.",2023,2025-05-22 17:50:28,2025-05-26 12:44:20,2025-05-22 17:50:16,648–652,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
