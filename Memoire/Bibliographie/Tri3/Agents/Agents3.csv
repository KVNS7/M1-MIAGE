However, when faced with more complex and interconnected tasks that demand a profound and iterative thought process, LLMs reveal their inherent limitations. Autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems represent a strategic response to these challenges. While these architectures hold promising potential in amplifying AI capabilities, striking the right balance between different levels of autonomy and alignment remains the crucial challenge for their effective operation. This paper proposes a comprehensive multi-dimensional taxonomy, engineered to analyze how autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems balance the dynamic interplay between autonomy and alignment across various aspects inherent to architectural viewpoints such as goal-driven task management, agent composition, multi-agent collaboration, and context interaction. Our taxonomy aims to empower researchers, engineers, and AI practitioners to systematically analyze the architectural dynamics and balancing strategies employed by these increasingly prevalent AI systems. The exploratory taxonomic classification of selected representative LLM-powered multi-agent systems illustrates its practical utility and reveals potential for future research and development.

Moreover, Lb resistant gene is the correct name, but, not Stb gene. It has sexual and asexual parts on the mycelia, known as heterothallic fungi. Its pathogenic diversity ranged from 40% to 93% and has produced a wide variety of AvrLb6 haplotypes. M. graminicola has a plasmogamy and karyogamy sexual process. The pathogen can use macropycnidiospores, micropycnidiospores, and pycnidia vegetative growths for infection and overwintering. Synthetic M3, Kavkaz-K4500, Synthetic 6×, and TE9111 wheat genotypes have horizontal resistance. Avirulence (Avr) genes in Z. tritici and their matching wheat (R) genes indicate gene for gene mechanisms of resistance. Twenty-two R genes (vertical resistance) have been identified. In both horizontal and vertical resistance, different Lb genes have been broken down due to new Z.tritici virulent gene and currently Lb19 resistant gene is being recommended. Mixing of resistant and susceptible cultivars is also the most effective management strategy. Moreover, different cultural practices and biological control have been proposed.

In fact, a significant number of publications claim PCV-3  as a disease causal infectious agent, but very few of them have shown strong evidence of such potential causality. The most convincing proofs of disease association  are those that demonstrate a clinical picture linked to multisystemic lymphoplasmacytic to lymphohistiocytic perivascular inflammation and presence of viral nucleic acid  within these lesions. Based on these evidence, individual case definitions for PCV-3reproductive disease and PCV-3-systemic disease are proposed to standardize diagnostic criteria for PCV-3-associated diseases.

In 1885 copper was found to suppress many pathogens, and is still the most effective way to control downy mildews. During the twentieth century, contact and penetrating single-site fungicides have been developed for use against plant pathogens including downy mildews, but wide application has led to the appearance of pathogenic strains resistant to these treatments. Additionally, due to the negative environmental impact of chemical pesticides, the European Union restricted their use, triggering a rush to develop alternative tools such as resistant cultivars breeding, creation of new active ingredients, search for natural products and biocontrol agents that can be applied alone or in combination to kill the pathogen or mitigate its effect.

This development was caused by the increased use of black-box models and a realization of the importance of trustworthy AI. In particular, explanations are necessary for human–agent interactions to ensure that the user can trust the agent and that collaborations are effective. Human–agent interactions are complex social scenarios involving a user, an autonomous agent, and an environment or task with its own distinct properties. Thus, such interactions require a wide variety of explanations, which are not covered by the methods of a single AI discipline, such as computer vision or natural language processing. In this paper, we map out what types of explanations are important for human–agent interactions, surveying the field via a scoping review. In addition to the typical introspective explanation tackled by explainability researchers, we look at assistive explanations, aiming to support the user with their task. Secondly, we survey what causes the need for an explanation in the first place. We identify a variety of human–agent interaction-specific causes and categorize them by whether they are centered on the agent’s behavior, the user’s mental state, or an external entity.

Following 16S rRNA screening, we focused on the genus               Paraburkholderia               , which harbors strains with large genomes and versatile benefits to plants. A strain designated P39 was selected, identified, and characterized for its biocontrol activity against               Colletotrichum scovillei               . Strain P39 exhibited antagonism against               C. scovillei               by producing compounds, including volatiles, with antifungal activity, both               in vitro               and on pepper fruits. Genomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses revealed that the selected strain represents a novel species, named               Paraburkholderia busanensis               . Genomic analyses provided insights into the fitness and biocontrol activities of the selected strains. Moreover, P39 displays mycophagy, consuming fungal mycelia and transforming them into bacterial biomass, particularly in nutrient-poor media supplemented with fungal mycelia. The genome harbored chitin and N-acetylglucosamine utilization genes, suggesting a proposed pathway for the utilization of fungal cells as a nutrient source. Microscopic observations further supported the ability of this strain to rupture and damage fungal hyphae, depriving them of their cellular constituents. This study successfully demonstrated the implementation of a taxonomy-guided approach for the selection of bacterial strains for biocontrol. These findings contribute to our understanding of biocontrol strategies, bacteria-fungi interactions, and the identification of               Paraburkholderia busanensis               sp. nov. as a potential candidate for the biocontrol of pepper anthracnose. Additionally, this strain serves as a valuable resource for antifungal compounds and volatiles, and for the study of bacteria-fungal interactions and mycophagy.                                         IMPORTANCE                                Traditional control methods for postharvest diseases rely on fungicides, which cause human health and environmental concerns. This study introduces a taxonomy-guided strategy for selecting biocontrol agents. By focusing on                 Paraburkholderia                 group, which harbors diverse plant-beneficial strains, the inadvertent selection of harmful strains was circumvented, thereby obviating the need for laborious                 in vitro                 screening assays. A highly promising candidate, strain P39, has been identified, exhibiting remarkable biocontrol activity against                 Colletotrichum scovillei                 . Through comprehensive genomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses, P39 was characterized as a novel species within the                 Paraburkholderia                 genus and designated                 Paraburkholderia busanensis                 . Moreover, these findings deepen our understanding of bacterial-fungal interactions, as they elucidate a potential pathway for the utilization of fungal chitin, thereby enhancing our understanding of bacterial mycophagy.

To reduce the negative impact on the chestnut industry, the hymenopteran parasitoid               Torymus sinensis               Kamijo (Hymenoptera, Torymidae) was firstly translocated from China to Japan and then from Japan to other countries. From an agronomic point of view, this classical biological control programme is perceived as a great success story even if in Japan it was overshadowed by evidence of hybridisation with the indigenous species               Torymus beneficus               Yasumatsu & Kamijo. Based on numerous specimens collected in France and Italy but also in Asia, as well as on published data, we detected molecular and phenotypic signatures of a possible hybridisation. Our results evidenced for the first time that the European stock of               T. sinensis               has some rare molecular signatures of historical hybridisation that took place in Japan (0.66% of the mitochondrial haplotypes).

Therefore, it is important to investigate how to react and recover from breakdowns appropriately so that failures do not impair the CA experience lastingly. Examples for recovery strategies are the assumption of the most likely user intent (CA self-repair) or to ask for clarification (user-repair).

Additionally, for the complete adaptation of the space to the user, it is necessary to take the user’s preferences into account. Defining user preferences is a very complex area with numerous approaches, starting with the development of simple automated services in a smart home, where the user is offered control of a simple set of rules to define their wants and needs. The paper conducts an analysis of preference definitions in different environments and proposes a preference definition for the use case of smart lighting and smart heating and cooling system in a Multi-Agent System approach. This proposed definition forms the basis for effective negotiation between users with different preferences, where conflicts are inevitable.",2025,2025-05-22 17:50:28,2025-05-26 12:43:53,2025-05-22 17:50:10,43-52,,,406.0,,,,,,,,Springer Nature Singapore,Singapore,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,"Series Title: Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies DOI: 10.1007/978-981-97-6469-3_4",,,,,,"Jezic, Gordan; Chen-Burger, Y.-H.; Kušek, Mario; Šperka, Roman; Howlett, Robert J.; Jain, Lakhmi C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these valuable crops face a constant threat from various diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi and especially the notorious Phytophthora capsici. P. capsici, first identified as a pepper pathogen in New Mexico by L.H. Leonian in 1922, is a devastating Oomycete wreaking havoc on vegetable, ornamental and tropical crops worldwide. This pathogen thrives in both temperate and tropical environments and possesses an arsenal of abilities that make it a formidable adversary. P. capsici's high genetic diversity allows it to readily overcome fungicides and host resistance, while the formation of long-lasting oospores ensures its persistence in soil. Its ability to rapidly differentiate into infectious zoospores in the presence of water fuels epidemics and its broad host range amplifies economic losses and renders crop rotation less effective. The severity of P. capsici-induced diseases and the complex management challenges have spurred extensive research efforts. Here, we delve into recent discoveries regarding the biology, genetic diversity, disease management strategies and effector biology of this formidable Oomycete.",2024,2025-05-22 17:50:28,2025-05-26 12:42:20,2025-05-22 17:50:13,1–10,,1,52.0,,,Phytophthora capsici the Causal Agent of Phytophthora Blight of Capsicum spp.,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,Publisher: Egyptian Phytopathological Society (EPS),,/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/5KAWI29R/Rhouma et al. - 2024 - Phytophthora capsici the Causal Agent of Phytophthora Blight of Capsicum spp. From Its Taxonomy to.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate and address security vulnerabilities during the process of creating Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). This survey assesses different models that aim to guarantee the security of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). These models were developed based on principles related to the agents' functionality and communication. This study offers a comprehensive examination and categorization of the prevailing threats targeting Multi-Agent Systems (MASs). Following this, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and assessment of diverse security strategies described in scholarly sources, classifying them into prevention, detection, and resiliency approaches based on their established credibility and reliability.

On the other hand, there are agent-based approach, which can help to analyze pricing strategy, focusing on the interactions between companies and customers. Customer buying decisions are influenced by several customer preferences factors, while product prices depend on the company’s promotion strategy.

Utilizing data from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database (TPR-DB), the article illustrates how the temporal structure of keystroke and gaze data elicits the three assumed hidden mental processing strata.

Twelve Vertícíllíum isolates were studied and identified as Vertícíllíum fungícola (Preuss) Hassebrauk. A brief description of the fungus based in the collected material was done. A species of Glíocladíum, probably a nematode trapping fungus, was also identified. The best micelial growth temperature for all the Vertícillíum fungícola isolates in potato dextrose agar and in oat agar was determine to be around 21-27 ºC, but most of them had the best growth at 24 ºC. The differences in the optimum micelial growth temperature js an indication of populational variation. The conidia thermal death-point is 39-40ºC. Pathogenicity assays of V. fungícola showed that all the 12 isolates were pathogenic to A bísporus causing cinnamon-brown and irregular discolored spóts on the surface of the cap. Many spots of a varying size and outline may occl.Ír. Under moist conditions, the enlarging spots may coalesce to form a large blotch. Later the spot may become depressed and sunken. These mushroom are edible, but are of reduced quality and commercial value. The parasite can also invade the tissue of the stem thus causing a splitting and splitering, often producing a tilted and dwarfed cap. When such mushrooms are cut open, a hollow cavity is frequently seen, the walls of which are covered with a whitish growth. The mushroom becomes dry, shrunken, distorted and unfit for sale. Finally the ""bubble"" formation is indicative of heavy contamination of the casing soil and it was more present in the end of the cultures. In this case the newly forming buttons are infected ata very early stage. The invading hyphae of the parasite arrest development leading to pileo malformations. The stem becomes swollen into a puffball-like stucture which do not decay but remain dry and leathery.

This paper is aimed at giving accurate details on a previously and shortly announced synonymization with Aculops taihangensis, using a morphological and molecular approach. A fusiform morph of A. mosoniensis was distinguished from a vermiform morph and this latter was recognized as deutogyne, which was herein documented. Phylogenetic relationships between Chinese Ac. taihangensis and all A. mosoniensis mites collected in twenty localities in Europe were examined through the analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c subunit I (CO1) protein and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 region (ITS1). CO1 sequences of Ac. taihangensis from the Shandong province in China and those from mites collected in Austria and Slovenia were 100% identical; the ITS1 sequence of an Ac. taihangensis paratype matched for 99.8% with those obtained from protogynes and deutogynes of A. mosoniensis collected in Italy. All these data supported the announced synonymization of A. mosoniensis with Ac. taihangensis. Aculus mosoniensis was found genetically variable, with five CO1 haplotypes in Europe (becoming eight along with those of Ac. taihangensis) clustering in two highly supported maternal lineages and eight ITS1 haplotypes (becoming nine along with those of Ac. taihangensis) distributed in four supported clades. No overlap between intra- and interspecies distances was observed for both markers and all studied A. mosoniensis populations clustered in one monophyletic mitochondrial clade, suggesting that only one single species might occur in Europe. However, more mite clades may be related to more tree of heaven biotypes with potential ecological differences, which might have potential effects on the biological control and should be investigated.",2022,2025-05-22 17:51:50,2025-05-26 12:41:33,2025-05-22 17:51:49,489,,5,13.0,,,Integrative taxonomy and synonymization of Aculus mosoniensis (Acari,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,Publisher: MDPI,,/Users/ksoares/Zotero/storage/592SPHZC/489.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous papers (Bolis M et al., Ann Oncol. 2017, 28:611; Centritto F et al., EMBO Mol Med. 2015, 7:950) we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of ATRA in the personalized treatment of breast cancer. The present study is aimed at providing pre-clinical evidence supporting the use of pharmacological strategies based on ATRA in the management of stomach cancer, a very heterogeneous type of tumor, which lacks effective therapeutic options other than surgery. To define the sensitivity of gastric cancer to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA, we used 27 cell-lines, recapitulating the heterogeneity of the tumor. Fourteen of these cell-lines are characterized by a G-DIF phenotype, while the remainders present with a G-INT phenotype. Each cell-line was exposed to increasing concentrations of ATRA and the growth-inhibitory effects of the retinoid were evaluated at 3, 6, and 9 days. The 27 cell-lines were ranked for their sensitivity to the retinoid with the “ATRA-score”, a continuous/quantitative index, which we developed. The results indicate that the cell-lines can be divided into 3 separate groups characterized by high, intermediate and low sensitivity to ATRA. No significant correlation between ATRA-sensitivity and the G-DIF or G-INT phenotype is observed in our panel of cell-lines. To support the results of the cell-lines, we evaluated the anti-proliferative effects exerted by ATRA on short-term tissue slice cultures of primary tumors derived from 13 cases of stomach cancer, which we classified as G-DIF or G-INT following determination of the basal gene-expression profiles with the use of RNA-sequencing studies. The results obtained with the short-term tissue culture model confirm the data generated with the cell-lines. The whole genome RNA-sequencing studies performed in the cell-lines and short-term tissue cultures in basal conditions allowed us to define a model consisting of 42 genes whose expression is quantitatively correlated with ATRA-sensitivity. The model was used to predict the sensitivity of gastric cancer cases to ATRA using the TCGA dataset. The results obtained indicate that approximately 60% of the gastric cancer cases are predicted to be characterized by high/intermediate sensitivity to ATRA, regardless of the G-DIF or G-INT phenotype. In conclusion, our results support the concept that ATRA-based therapeutic strategies are likely to be beneficial in the majority of stomach cancer cases. In addition, we generate a gene-expression tool that may be used for the selection of ATRA-sensitive patients in the clinics.",2023,2025-05-22 17:51:50,2025-05-26 12:44:11,2025-05-22 17:51:50,1597–1597,,7_Supplement,83.0,,,"Sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to all-trans retinoic acid, a new agent in the personalized treatment of this heterogeneous tumor",,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,Publisher: The American Association for Cancer Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
